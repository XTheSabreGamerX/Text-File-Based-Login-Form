# Text-File-Based-Login-Form
In this program, it is kind of the same with my previous program, which was the Quiz that utilized a text file. In this program, the user has the ability to
register and log in!

# Register
When the user registers in the program, their data is stored within the text file.

# Login
In the login section, the user is able to log in to their accounts, depending if they're stored in there or not.
The program is able to do this by reading the text file line by line until it detects a null line. For each line, the program separates the username and password
with a comma.
